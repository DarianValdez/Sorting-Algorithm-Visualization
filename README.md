# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
Allows you to view how different in-place sorting algorithms work on a set of data.

This repository is a complete Visual Studio project, WPF application.  This was my final project for a programming ocurse.  It uses MVVM and Microsoft CLR/CLI to visualize sorting algorithms.  This program is installable, and the setup.exe and .msi are included in the SortingAlgorithmSetup/Release folder.  The requirements for the assignment required the use of C++, so the UI and ViewModel is in C# with the sorting algorithms implemented in C++.
